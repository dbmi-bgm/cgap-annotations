This documentation covers the sources of annotation used in CGAP for genes and variants.
It also provides information on the creation of custom reference files used in the CGAP Pipelines.

Copies of the files referred to in these docs are stored in the S3 bucket:

    s3://cgap-annotations

The bucket is private and not meant for public files sharing. It is intended for internal back-up only and most of the files are stored in deeper archive tiers.
